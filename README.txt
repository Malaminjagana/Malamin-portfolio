## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a responsive and versatile site template designed for personal and commercial use. The design is named "Malamin Jagana" because it's the fourth in the series. It provides ample space for showcasing various types of content, and it even features multilevel drop-down menus for added functionality.
